**Files Included**

orders.csv: Contains information about individual pizza orders.
pizza_types.csv: Lists different types of pizzas available.
pizzas.csv: Includes details about pizzas, such as size and type.
order_details.csv: Provides a breakdown of each order's details, including quantities and prices.
