## Project Overview:
This project involves analyzing pizza sales data from 4 CSV files, answering 13 questions that range from basic to advanced levels. The data is processed and analyzed using SQL to extract meaningful insights and drive data-driven decision-making.

## Data Summary** <br> 
**orders.csv:** Contains information about individual pizza orders.<br> 
**pizza_types.csv**: Lists different types of pizzas available.<br> 
**pizzas.csv:** Includes details about pizzas, such as size and type.<br> 
**order_details.csv:** Provides a breakdown of each order's details, including quantities and prices.

## Data Model

## Queries and Insights  

* Retrieve the total number of orders placed.<br> 
* Calculate the total revenue generated from pizza sales.<br> 
* Identify the highest-priced pizza.<br> 
* Identify the most common pizza size ordered.<br> 
* List the top 5 most ordered pizza types along with their quantities.
  
Intermediate:
* Join the necessary tables to find the total quantity of each pizza category ordered.<br> 
* Determine the distribution of orders by hour of the day.<br> 
* Join relevant tables to find the category-wise distribution of pizzas.<br> 
* Group the orders by date and calculate the average number of pizzas ordered per day.<br> 
* Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue.<br> 
  
Advanced:
* Calculate the percentage contribution of each pizza category to total revenue.<br> 
* Analyze the cumulative revenue generated over time.<br> 
* Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue for each pizza category.<br>
